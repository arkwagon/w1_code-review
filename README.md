# _Week 1 Code Review_

#### _Applying lessons learned in Week 1 of Epicodus: Intro To Programming, 01/09/16_

#### By _**Will Murphy**_

## Description

_I created a site for SpaceTrips... a mock space travel company using html, bootstrap, and custom css.  NOTE: When I logged into the epicenter for code review it took me [here](http://epicenter.epicodus.com/code_reviews/139). I did not see that we were supposed to create a portfolio site until 3pm. It would be great if we could all have a little meeting on Friday morning to make sure we're all headed in the right direction. I continued on with my SpaceTrips site in order to meet the review requirements. I will build the portfolio site on my own time I guess._
